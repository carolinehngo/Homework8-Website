    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>
        I have worked on a few projects during my time at the University of Oklahoma.
        Some of these include a project for my Databases class utilizing SQL, creating complex ERDs, and presenting milestones throughout the semester.
        I have also created repositories on GitHub for my Programming courses.
        I am also working on a client consulting project for Field Project. This involves researching the company and new systems for their IT team.
        Lastly, I am also working on a project for the Price College of Business Capsone course. I am working on an industry report and analysis of Amazon and giving reccomendations for improvements to the firm.
